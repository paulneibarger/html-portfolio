<h1>The Best Movies According to Paul</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>I could have used up all three movies but I grouped these together so that there are a few more movies</p>
<h3>Starship Troopers</h3>
<p>
  Albeit the book was far superior than the movie, the way the movie was made to a propaganda film was excellent. The
  casting was spot on. The special effects where believable. The corny gore was fitting as well.

<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>some comparisons between the two films. Talk about the soundtrack. Throw in amazing CGI</p>
